### Changing the Launch Date

The countdown timer is set to 3 months from the current date by default. To change this:

2. Find the `updateCountdown()` function
3. Modify the `launchDate` variable to your desired launch date

### Custom Colors

The color scheme can be modified in the `styles.css` file by changing the CSS variables in the `:root` selector:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #0057b7; /* Ocean blue */
  --accent-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --dark-blue: #003a7a;
  --light-blue: #4c99e6;
}
```

### Newsletter Form

The newsletter form currently displays a success message when submitted but does not actually store the email addresses. To connect it to a backend:

1. Modify the form submission code in `script.js`
2. Add your API endpoint or server-side code to process the form data
